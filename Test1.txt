Steve Bannon’s days at the White House are over, but questions remain over how much influence — or chaos — he will cause from the outside.

While the chief strategist’s ouster is a victory for new White House chief of staff John Kelly and his goal of eliminating leaks and bringing order to the West Wing, some believe Bannon could be an even more disruptive force for the Trump administration from the outside.

Bannon returned to Breitbart News immediately after his departure. He had turned the news site into a right-wing juggernaut as chairman before joining the Trump campaign.


“Steve’s allies in the populist-nationalist movement are ready to ride to the gates of hell with him against the West Wing Democrats and globalists like [deputy national security adviser] Dina Powell, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, [economic adviser] Gary Cohn and [national security adviser] H.R. McMaster,” said one Bannon ally.
“They should all be very worried that their efforts to undermine the president will be exposed,” the ally continued. “If they think what’s happened with Steve is rough, wait until they see what he does outside the White House.”

One of Bannon’s friends called it his “Obi Wan Kenobi” moment, referencing the Jedi master from Star Wars who was felled by Darth Vader. “They will strike him down for him to become more powerful than they ever imagined,” the friend said.

That may be true, but for the time being Bannon’s ouster is a defeat for the administration’s chief proponent of economic nationalism and his allies. Questions were quickly raised about whether White House aides Sebastian Gorka and Julia Hahn, who both came to Trump’s orbit from Breitbart, might be leaving the White House next.

Bannon became a fixture in Trump’s orbit during the 2016 campaign. But he ultimately never found his footing in the turbulent West Wing, where he courted controversy and feuded constantly with other top aides.

Ideological foes to Bannon included Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.

His departure has sparked fears among Trump’s core supporters that the president might stray from the economic nationalist message he rode into the White House.

The now-former chief strategist was accused of being the source of leaks for unflattering stories about Kushner, Cohn, McMaster and others, many of which appeared in Breitbart.

“He will continue to use his weapon of choice, Breitbart, to attack his adversaries inside the West Wing,” said Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart spokesman and Trump critic. “He will relentlessly attack congressional Republican leadership like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell (and Jeff Flake & John McCain).”

In the aftermath of his dismissal, some Breitbart employees declared “war” on Bannon’s enemies and turned on Trump.

Conservatives lashed out, fearing that Trump had capitulated to the “liberal” wing of the White House.

“I’m very upset. The deep state globalists won,” said Tea Party activist Debbie Dooley. “They forced out Steve Bannon. I had a CNN is fake news protest scheduled for tomorrow at their headquarters in Atlanta that I’m cancelling because I’m so disheartened. It’s a betrayal of his base. I’ll continue to support Trump and his policies but I’ll no longer be on the frontlines defending him.”

But some Republicans say the move could benefit the White House in the short term, allowing Kelly to build cohesion among a staff that has split into factions and been consumed by infighting since the beginning.
